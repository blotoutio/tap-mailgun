## Why are we changing this?

- Make it easy to understand, write it for people outside your team.

## What has changed?

- You know the ins and out of the code, the reviewer might not.
- Add any specific implementation details or anything non-obvious that a reviewer should look out for.

## How to test it and expected results?

- Make it easy to test, give explicit step-by-step instructions, e.g. graphql queries, commands, screenshots and/or videos of what to do.
- Make it obvious it works, include screenshots or pastes of output so it's clear what the reviewer should expect.
